        Many of these ingredients can be found in Asian or specialty shops. 
        Chili paste with soy bean oil comes in small jars and can be found in most Asian markets. 
        Galangal, a member of the ginger family, is a knobby root that tastes like a cross between ginger and pepper. 
        Tom Yum Soup paste can be found in Asian shops, 
        or you can use Thai red curry paste. Makrut lime leaves have an aromatic citrus-like smell and flavor. 
        Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves.
